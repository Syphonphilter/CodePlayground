## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) in TypeScript
## Overview
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a fundamental principle in object-oriented design. It emphasizes that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. In TypeScript, this principle guides us in designing interfaces that are focused, cohesive, and specific to the requirements of implementing classes.
