## About
 Knowing that objects are easy to create and initilaize uisng a single initialize there can be times that multiple aruments needs to be passed and passing these areguments to the constructor is not good practice thus make us of piece wise construction where you call special parts of the component called the builder 
 ## Advantage 
 Making use of chaining invocation technique so that the params would be properly passed.
